<h1 class="title" id="page-title">	Collaboratories in Social and Economic History	</h1>	<p style="text-align: justify"><span class="firstletter">T</span>his portal aims to facilitate new, cooperative research practices in the field of comparative and global social economic history. Global history sets specific demands on research data. To collect really comparable data, agreements have to be made on definitions, estimation methods, annotation and documentation. The data may have to be processed in order make them available to the research community. To create such valuable datasets, intense cooperation between scholars all over the world is needed. This cooperation can benefit from ICT-enabled platforms that create &lsquo;virtual research environments&rsquo; or &lsquo;collaboratories&rsquo;.</p><p style="text-align: justify">In this portal several international working groups have a platform for cooperation:</p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px"><a href="/collabs/?project=hisco/home"><img hspace="20" alt="" vspace="10" align="right" width="37" height="50" src="/image/image_gallery?uuid=cd08050b-f2ea-4727-b1cc-ac2274bf6d7d&amp;groupId=11166&amp;t=1253177099781" /></a><a href="/collabs/?project=hisco/about"><strong><span style="font-size: larger">HISCO</span></strong></a><span style="font-size: larger">&nbsp;</span>This collaboratory aims to create an occupational information system that is both international and historical, and simultaneously links to existing classifications used for present-day conditions.

In this collaboratory, besides providing information and exchanging opinions, we work to create common data structures and software.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px"><a href="/collabs/?project=LabourRelations/"><img hspace="20" alt="" vspace="10" align="right" width="45" height="50" src="/image/image_gallery?uuid=d68e1e96-05dd-4c77-8225-1fe11f9f5b9c&amp;groupId=11169&amp;t=1253177126603" /></a><a href="/collabs/?project=LabourRelations/"><strong><span style="font-size: larger">History of Labour Relations</span></strong></a>&nbsp;This collaboratory makes an inventory of all types of labour relations worldwide, varying from slavery, indentured labour and share cropping, to free wage labour and self-employment from 1500 up until today.

The repository operates on the principle of a historical data-hub, bringing together data extracted from various published and unpublishedsources in one place. The repository provides regional level data, standardised to facilitate access and to enable comparative research over time and across space. The principal focus of the data-hub is Russian economic and social history of the last three centuries (18th-21st).</p>

Data on prices and wages are among the most important sources of information in social- and economic-historical research, especially for the pre-statistical period. The International Institute of Social History (IISH) has taken the initiative to set up a network of scholars working with this kind of data and establish a moderated list of datafiles of historical prices and wages.
